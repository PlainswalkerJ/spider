# World of warcraft Logs spider
Get DPS players'performance in Tomb of Sargeras,including 12 classes and 24 DPS specs,following the address rules of wcl network.You will finally get 216(24*9 24 specs and 9 bosses in tos) htmlfiles which are the sourcecode of wcl page for one class and one of its spec,containing the top100 players's gears,talents,damage and other information,and 216 excels for these information(ID,dps,two legendary gears,etc).

The spider works with phantomJS and you should change the phantomJS address when you want spider work.

To overcome some annoying bugs,the code is not so clear and may be confusing.

DPS in excels are string,you need to transform it into number by your excel apps.

MAY NOT UPDATE FOREVER!(but you can take and use it)
